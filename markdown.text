 I am writing to escalate an incident that occurred during our scheduled call on March 27th, 2024, from 03:00 PM to 03:30 PM, regarding a critical issue impacting the performance of the Nexus 2.0 Reports App. The purpose of the call was to discuss the ongoing problem of duplicate API calls adversely affecting page load performance. 
 During the meeting, I, along with Varsha and Lokesh, outlined the efforts made to address the issue. Specifically, I detailed the actions taken since February 29th, 2024, in collaboration with Eason and Gayathri. As of now, the Nexus 2.0 Reports App takes approximately 1 minute to load the First Contentful Paint (FCP), with one of the API calls, "/reportgeneration," consuming 46 seconds and downloading 80MB of data from the network.
 In response to this performance bottleneck, our team diligently worked to analyze and resolve the issue. Our efforts resulted in a significant reduction in API response size, from 80MB to 4MB, and a substantial decrease in page load time to just a few seconds. Subsequently, we collectively agreed to deploy these changes to the PROD BETA environment. Eason raised the pull request (PR) on March 13th, and it was promptly merged into the release branch. On March 14th, the changes were released to Product owners for testing.
 However, the discussion took an unexpected turn when I raised concerns about the recent introduction of duplicate API calls. Varsha's response to my inquiries was highly unprofessional and disruptive.
 Varsha's demeanor during the call was characterized by disrespect, loudness, arrogance, and shouting, both on the Zoom call and in the physical workplace, causing embarrassment to everyone involved. Despite numerous attempts to steer the conversation back to a professional tone, Varsha persisted in her unacceptable behavior for over 20 minutes, attracting attention from other team members.
 Specifically, when asked about the PR responsible for introducing the issue, Varsha's response was dismissive and evasive, stating it was challenging to locate the relevant PR among millions. However, the reality is that only a limited number of PRs were raised during the timeframe in question, and Varsha herself contributed six PRs. Such disregard for accountability and team collaboration is unacceptable and undermines our collective efforts to address critical issues.
 I must express my deep frustration and demotivation stemming from this incident. As a relatively new member of the project, having joined on February 28th, 2024, I have encountered similar dismissive attitudes from Varsha whenever seeking assistance or clarification. This ongoing behavior is detrimental to my mental health and well-being, as well as the productivity and morale of the entire team.
 Therefore, I urge you to conduct a thorough investigation into this matter and take appropriate action to address Varsha's behavior and ensure a professional and respectful work environment for all team members. It is imperative that such incidents are addressed promptly to maintain team cohesion and productivity.
I am available to provide further clarification or assistance as needed.
